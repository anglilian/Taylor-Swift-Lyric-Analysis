# Taylor-Swift-Lyric-Analysis
This project exploration examines how textual analysis on Taylor Swift lyrics could be applied to a Capstone project on textual analysis on a corpus in the field of humanities. Given that the use of data analysis techniques in humanities is a fairly niche, the successful completion of this project exploration has shown that it would be a viable product for my Capstone project.
